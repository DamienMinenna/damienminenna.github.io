                        <h2 class="section-heading"> Introduction </h2>

                        <p>
                          For more than half a century, Fortran compilers have been optimised to reach the highest performances,
                          including memory access,
                          and they are quite good at it.
                          However, the way we store data in arrays can degrade those performances.
                          During massive simulations, the time spends
                          on memory access to retrieve values from huge arrays can be harmful for time efficiency.
                          To deal with arrays, the most effective approach is to iterate over the order in which they are stored in memory.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          In this tutorial, we'll propose three methods to store our data.
                          The first one relies only on <a href="#Method1">1D arrays</a>,
                          the second one use a single <a href="#Method2">2D array</a>
                          and the last one rely on <a href="#Method3">derived data type</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          The code used for the example is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/DamienMinenna/df7be9172e0411c8b596a72f6b0504f5" target="_blank">here</a>.
                          To facilitate understanding of the methods, we named the variables, respectively:
                          positions x, y, z;
                          velocities vx, vy, vz; amplitude Ax, Ay and Az; and a phase Phi.
                          To check the efficiency of each method, we run a dummy time algorithm
                          with 100 time steps where we perform the same operations on each variable.
                        </p>

                        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                          The run time claims here can differ significantly 
                          depending on many things such as hardware (processors, memory, etc.),
                          compilers, compilation options, etc.
                        </div>

                        <h2 class="section-heading" id="Method1"> Method 1: only 1D arrays </h2>

                        <p>
                          The first method is to have an 1D array for each variable.
                          It is probably not the "cleanest" approach, but it is the simplest to understand.
                          The main drawback is that, we each new variable, we need to write the new array and allocate it.
                          After more than 20-30 variables, this method becomes unnecessary redundant.
                        </p>

                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/DamienMinenna/a0fe4124feb887ce4ff320f893da0282.js"></script>

                        <p>
                          When testing this method for 10 000 particles during 100 step times,
                          the run time is <b>5.044 seconds</b> long. Not bad, but can we improve it?
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading" id="Method2"> Method 2: one 2D array </h2>

                        <p>
                          The second method is put all the datasets into a single 2D array.
                        </p>

                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/DamienMinenna/86c4fb4ac8d48f676ae3b983dc2beada.js"></script>

                        <p>
                          Then we allocate it with 
                        </p>

                        <pre>allocate(particle(n, p_DIM))</pre>
                        <p>
                          Notice the integers <tt>p_x, p_y, ...</tt>. There are just indexes to name the variables and to help you access it.
                          Instead of writing <tt>particle(i, 9)</tt> to access the 9th variable of your <tt>i</tt>th particle, use 
                          <tt>particle(i, p_NAME)</tt> with <tt>p_NAME</tt> the name of your variable.
                          When you need a new variable, just add its index and increment <tt>p_DIM</tt>. This method allows you to quickly organize your data.
                          The data must be of the same type (integer, real, ...).
                        </p>


                        <p>
                          It is well-known that, in Fortran, arrays are stored in
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order" target="_blank">column-major order</a>.
                          The order in which you allocate the 2D array can drastically increase the run time.
                          
                          If you correctly allocate the 2D array (assuming <tt>n > p_DIM</tt>) as
                        </p>
                          <pre>allocate(particle(n, p_DIM))</pre>
                        <p>
                          the run time with our example is <b>6.371 seconds</b>.
                          It's a little bit longer than the first method, but the discrepancy is not terrible.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Hovewer, if you allocate the 2D array as
                        </p>
                        <pre>allocate(particle(p_DIM, n))</pre>
                        <p>
                          the run time reaches <b>57.469 seconds</b>! Ten times longer while the only difference in the code is that we call our variables
                          <tt>particle(p_NAME, i)</tt> instead of <tt>particle(i, p_NAME)</tt>. 
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="section-heading"> Pointers </h4>
                        <p>
                          If you don't like using the indexes, you can define a pointer to each varable
                        </p>
                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/DamienMinenna/07c7f1733cccabe3a6be561e05f5d6a2.js"></script>
                        <p>
                          Then you can access and modify the data using <tt>particle_x(i)</tt> as for the 1D arrays. The run time with 10 pointers is <b>6.397 seconds</b> long 
                          (with the 2D array correctly allocated). Just a tad slower than without the pointers.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading" id="Method3"> Method 3: using type </h2>

                        <p>
                          In Fortran, we can use derived data types to create objects.
                          With our example, we have two possibilities: create 10 000 objects, each with 10 individual variables or
                          create a single object with 10 arrays of size 10 000. 
                          We can initiate the 10 000 objects as (we also give an example of how we can use a procedure)
                        </p>

                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/DamienMinenna/6f8446c3b1f8745d19c7d7dec2603ef3.js"></script>

                        <p>
                          The objects are allocated using <tt>allocate(particle(n))</tt> and we access the values using the syntax <tt>particle(i)%x</tt>.
                          However, here the run time of our example is <b>57.506 seconds</b>. Almost the same as if we use a row-major 2D array.
                          This is because Fortran will organize the memory in a similar way.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          The other possibility relies on a single object. Note that, to allocate the variables, we rely on a procedure contained 
                          within the type. 
                        </p>

                        <script src="https://gist.github.com/DamienMinenna/81baf65d6eb83e6f7ec22d73e55b8ae6.js"></script>

                        <p>
                          Here, we access the values using the syntax <tt>particle%x(i)</tt>.
                          The run time with our example is <b>5.030 seconds</b>.
                          Jackpot!
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading" id="conclu"> Conclusion </h2>

                        <p>
                          As seen with our example, a simple change in the organization of
                          datasets can add a factor 10 in the run time.
                          The three methods proposed, if correctly used, give nearly the same efficiency.
                        </p>
